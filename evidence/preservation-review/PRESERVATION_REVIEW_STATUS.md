# Archaeology preservation review status

Date: 2026-09-28
Status: `PARTIAL_BLOCKED`
Goal: preserve and adjudicate the scoped donor modularisation history

## Canonical owner

- Host: ArtVault
- Workspace: `/srv/artvault/projects/giga-archaeologist/workspace`
- Branch: `codex/artvault-portable-giga-archaeology`
- Baseline HEAD before the preservation-ledger increment: `cddc30e165928e83316e3116b129a9183a3dceb0`
- Upstream: `origin/codex/artvault-portable-giga-archaeology`
- Baseline HEAD/upstream equality: `0 ahead, 0 behind`
- Preservation-ledger revision subsequently pushed and fetched: `8844a39008b98a38aba357b5eb28c2eae704db65`
- Existing untracked `__pycache__` directories: preserved
- Authority-register ArtVault entry head: `2f9f5a3b576b7558274d9a22cae43410d160ef6e`
- Authority-register worker state: `launch_pending`
- Exact register ownership state: ArtVault `canonical_development_owner`; legacy Mac
  entry `inactive_after_artvault_handoff`
- Register head/worker fields: stale relative to current HEAD and this same-session goal; register not modified

The registered authority is `/srv/artvault/control/machine-authority.v1.json`. Its
ArtVault handoff names this workspace as the canonical development owner and explicitly
supersedes the legacy Mac-wide canonical field for this destination. The authority file
was read only and was not modified.

## Donor coverage

- Expected donor ref: `codex/preserve-giga-modularisation-history-20260928`
- Expected donor commit: `d29d209e9094302937c60d28aeab7a54f78ede27`
- Expected scope: 62 Python files and 33,497 additions
- Verified files: `0/62`
- Verified additions: `0/33,497`
- Verified dispositions: `0`
- Verified canonical integrations: `0`

## Exact blocker

The donor commit and ref are absent from the canonical repository's local objects and
refs. A scoped query of the configured `giga-user-archive` remote for the exact branch
failed in the normal runtime with:

`fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Pepstee/giga-user.git/': Could not resolve host: github.com`

The same exact-ref query through the approved network route failed with:

`fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such device or address`

No full donor-history fetch, clone, worktree, mirror, project snapshot, or private-corpus
transfer was attempted. A scoped code-only donor export or an accessible read-only ref is
required before file-level review can begin.

The configured named remote URL is `https://github.com/Pepstee/giga-user.git`, and the
exact donor commit object check also returned `fatal: Not a valid object name`; no donor
object was imported.

## Scoped tarball comparison evidence

`/srv/artvault/incoming/archaeology-scoped-candidate.tar.gz` is retained as comparison
evidence only. It is not the named donor ref and does not establish donor coverage.

- SHA-256: `489e26ec657399fa5a0167769cc34383643cfcd5b2f56807d1568167da37de43`
- Archive regular files: `78`
- Archive regular-file bytes: `2,482,217`
- Archive date: `2026-09-09`
- Ref/commit provenance: absent
- Extraction: none
- In-memory stream comparison with current canonical source: `65` exact matches, `13` different, `0` missing
- Archive-to-canon line delta: `+209/-87`
- Observed differences: current-canon portability, optional Giga integration, explicit sandbox opt-out, code-only Graphify metadata, and related tests

The comparison-only differing paths are:

- `modules/operations/archaeology/history.py`
- `modules/operations/archaeology/hypotheses.py`
- `modules/operations/archaeology/inventory.py`
- `modules/operations/archaeology/mapper.py`
- `modules/operations/archaeology/navigation_inventory.py`
- `modules/operations/archaeology/navigation_maintenance.py`
- `modules/operations/archaeology/retention.py`
- `modules/operations/archaeology/scip_map.py`
- `modules/operations/scripts/archaeology.py`
- `scripts/graphify_codex_backend.py`
- `tests/test_archaeology_hypotheses.py`
- `tests/test_archaeology_mapper.py`
- `tests/test_graphify_codex_backend.py`

This is a bounded tarball-to-canon path mapping only. The 65 exact paths and these 13
different paths are not donor-file verification, feature disposition, or evidence for
the named donor ref; donor coverage remains `0/62`.

For each differing path, the comparison target is the same relative path in the
canonical workspace; its current disposition is `comparison-only / donor provenance
unverified`, pending proof of the named donor ref:

| Comparison path | Canonical target | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `modules/operations/archaeology/history.py` | same canonical path | comparison-only; provenance unverified |
| `modules/operations/archaeology/hypotheses.py` | same canonical path | comparison-only; provenance unverified |
| `modules/operations/archaeology/inventory.py` | same canonical path | comparison-only; provenance unverified |
| `modules/operations/archaeology/mapper.py` | same canonical path | comparison-only; provenance unverified |
| `modules/operations/archaeology/navigation_inventory.py` | same canonical path | comparison-only; provenance unverified |
| `modules/operations/archaeology/navigation_maintenance.py` | same canonical path | comparison-only; provenance unverified |
| `modules/operations/archaeology/retention.py` | same canonical path | comparison-only; provenance unverified |
| `modules/operations/archaeology/scip_map.py` | same canonical path | comparison-only; provenance unverified |
| `modules/operations/scripts/archaeology.py` | same canonical path | comparison-only; provenance unverified |
| `scripts/graphify_codex_backend.py` | same canonical path | comparison-only; provenance unverified |
| `tests/test_archaeology_hypotheses.py` | same canonical path | comparison-only; provenance unverified |
| `tests/test_archaeology_mapper.py` | same canonical path | comparison-only; provenance unverified |
| `tests/test_graphify_codex_backend.py` | same canonical path | comparison-only; provenance unverified |

These facts do not change donor coverage, which remains `0/62` files and `0/33,497`
additions until the named donor commit is proven.

## Delegation and graph boundary

- Suitable donor batches: `BLOCKED`, because synchronized code-only inputs are unavailable.
- GLM worker launch: none. No alternate model or duplicate worker was substituted.
- Graph status: `STALE`. The existing source-graph manifest predates the current repair and
  does not include `modules/operations/archaeology/os_support.py` or
  `tests/test_os_support.py`.
- Whole-donor, no-feature-loss, retirement, and cleanup claims: not made.

## Unaffected verified work

- Windows non-blocking lock error classification repaired in
  `modules/operations/archaeology/os_support.py`.
- Focused repair tests added in `tests/test_os_support.py`.
- Affected verification: `101 passed`.
- Repair commit: `cddc30e165928e83316e3116b129a9183a3dceb0`.
- Repair commit pushed and fetched; local HEAD and upstream equal that exact revision.

## Required continuation

Reopen this status only when a scoped, code-only source for the named donor ref is
available. Then produce the complete per-file/per-feature coverage ledger, canonical
mapping, disposition, independent validation, integration result, and remote revision
proof. Until then this review remains `PARTIAL_BLOCKED`.

## Remote revision proof

- Repair revision: `cddc30e165928e83316e3116b129a9183a3dceb0`
- Preservation-ledger revision: `8844a39008b98a38aba357b5eb28c2eae704db65`
- The preservation-ledger revision was pushed to
  `origin/codex/artvault-portable-giga-archaeology` and fetched back; the exact check
  was `0 ahead, 0 behind`.
